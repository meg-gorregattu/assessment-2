Three software/technology companies that interest me:
-Google
-Apple
-Salesforce

According to a blogpost from apxor.com, Google uses Python, Java, Android SDK, Go, C++, Preact, Angular JS, Kubernetes, TensorFlow as well as various other google frameworks. Python is one of their official languages and is used because it has fast delivery and is relatively easy to use.

According to stackshare.io, Apple uses Swift, Objective-C, Cocoa Touch, and Cocoa for application and data. For DevOps, Xcode, TeamCity, and Pingdom are used.

Salesforce CRM uses Visualforce to create custom interactive user interfaces (UI) for mobile and web apps-- this is used because it is easy to learn and it enhances the look of mobile and web apps.
